1. don't use tuples for serialization
2. don't expose as public (issues with equality) properties //at least right now
3. use them in algorithms to make them more readable
4. don't forger about deconstructing to tuples, and that you can add deconstruction via extension methods
5. remember about the discard ==> _ <== operator (as it will also be used in future in other C# features)
